   <p>The following projects I have completed all within the past year and have
   several others that I am currently working on. This is one of my proudest
   pages, because its where I get to show off all of the cool stuff I have 
   created (either individually or as part of a team). Please let me know what
   you think of any of these projects or you would like something similar for
   your project. So lets get to it!</p>
